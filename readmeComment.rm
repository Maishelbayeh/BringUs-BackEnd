# Social Media Testimonials (SocialComment) Feature – Summary

## 1. Feature Name & Purpose
**Social Media Testimonials** (`SocialComment`) allow each store to display curated social proof (comments, endorsements, etc.) from various social platforms. All testimonials are strictly scoped to the current store (multi-tenancy).

---

## 2. Files Created
- **Model:** `Models/SocialComment.js`
  - Mongoose schema for testimonials, with store reference and all required fields.
- **Controller:** `Controllers/SocialCommentController.js`
  - Handles CRUD operations, store isolation, and response formatting.
- **Routes:** `Routes/socialComment.js`
  - RESTful API endpoints, middleware, and full Swagger JSDoc documentation.
- **Validation Middleware:** `validators/socialComment.validator.js`
  - Express-validator rules for POST/PUT requests.
- **Swagger Documentation:**
  - Inline in `Routes/socialComment.js`, including schema definition and response formats.

---

## 3. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/social-comments` – List all testimonials for the current store
- `POST /api/social-comments` – Create a new testimonial
- `PUT /api/social-comments/:id` – Update an existing testimonial
- `DELETE /api/social-comments/:id` – Delete a testimonial

All endpoints:
- Require authentication and owner permissions
- Return responses in `{ success, data }` or `{ success, message }` format

---

## 4. Middleware Used
- `protect` – Ensures the user is authenticated
- `permissions(['owner'])` – Restricts access to store owners
- (Store context is assumed to be set by upstream middleware, e.g., `addStoreFilter` or similar)
- Validation middleware from `validators/socialComment.validator.js` for POST/PUT

---

## 5. Swagger Coverage & Schema
- All endpoints are fully documented with Swagger JSDoc in `Routes/socialComment.js`
- Inline schema definition for `SocialComment` (fields: store, platform, image, personName, personTitle, comment, active, timestamps)
- All responses documented for 200/201/400/404/500 with example payloads
- Tag used: `[SocialComment]`

---

## 6. Multi-Tenant Handling & Store Isolation
- Every testimonial is linked to a specific store via the `store` field (ObjectId)
- All controller queries are scoped to the current store (using `req.store`)
- No cross-store access is possible
- Store deletion (future): testimonials should be cleaned up via a pre-remove hook on the Store model

---

## 7. Validation Rules
- `platform`: Required, must be one of ['Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Twitter', 'LinkedIn', 'TikTok']
- `personName`: Required, not empty
- `comment`: Required, minimum 10 characters
- `active`: Optional, must be boolean if present

---

## 8. Future Considerations
- **Image Upload:** Integrate with existing upload utilities for the `image` field
- **Store Deletion:** Add a pre-remove hook to the Store model to cascade-delete testimonials
- **Frontend Integration:** Ensure API and schema are reflected in the admin UI
- **Additional Permissions:** Consider finer-grained permissions if needed
