# Payment Security & Webhook Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the secure payment implementation with Lahza payment gateway, including webhook support for reliable subscription activation.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Security Improvements** ‚úÖ
- **Removed hardcoded secret key from frontend** - Secret keys are now stored securely in the backend database
- **Backend proxy for payment API** - All Lahza API calls now go through the backend
- **Protected endpoints** - Frontend calls backend endpoints instead of directly calling Lahza

### 2. **Webhook Implementation** ‚úÖ
- **Server-side payment confirmation** - Subscriptions are activated even if user doesn't return to the site
- **Reliable payment processing** - Handles network failures, browser crashes, etc.
- **Automatic subscription activation** - Backend activates subscription when payment is confirmed

### 3. **Frontend Improvements** ‚úÖ
- **Disabled close button during payment** - Prevents accidental closure during payment processing
- **Payment state persistence** - All payment data saved to localStorage for tracking
- **Better error handling** - Clear error messages and status tracking

---

## Architecture

### Before (Insecure)
```
Frontend ‚Üí Lahza API (with hardcoded secret key)
     ‚Üì
  User returns to site
     ‚Üì
  Subscription activated
```

**Problems:**
- Secret key exposed in frontend code
- Subscription only activated if user returns
- No handling for network failures

### After (Secure)
```
Frontend ‚Üí Backend API
             ‚Üì
        Backend ‚Üí Lahza API (secret key secure)
             ‚Üì
        Lahza ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Backend
             ‚Üì
        Auto-activate subscription
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Secret key protected in backend
- ‚úÖ Subscription activated via webhook (reliable)
- ‚úÖ Works even if user doesn't return
- ‚úÖ Handles network failures gracefully

---

## Backend Changes

### New Files/Functions

#### 1. **LahzaPaymentService.js** - Added Webhook Handler
```javascript
async handleWebhook(webhookData, storeId) {
  // Verifies payment
  // Returns payment status
  // Processes subscription activation
}
```

#### 2. **LahzaPaymentController.js** - Webhook Endpoint
```javascript
exports.handleWebhook = async (req, res) => {
  // Receives webhook from Lahza
  // Activates subscription if payment successful
  // Returns 200 to acknowledge
}
```

#### 3. **Routes/lahzaPayment.js** - New Route
```javascript
POST /api/lahza-payment/:storeId/webhook
```

### Existing Endpoints (Already Present)
- `POST /api/lahza-payment/:storeId/initialize` - Initialize payment
- `POST /api/lahza-payment/:storeId/verify` - Verify payment
- `GET /api/lahza-payment/:storeId/status/:reference` - Get payment status

---

## Frontend Changes

### Updated Files

#### 1. **payment.ts** - Configuration
```typescript
// REMOVED: Hardcoded secret key
// ADDED: Backend API configuration
export const PAYMENT_API_CONFIG = {
  BACKEND_URL: getBackendBaseUrl(),
  ENDPOINTS: {
    INITIALIZE: '/lahza-payment/:storeId/initialize',
    VERIFY: '/lahza-payment/:storeId/verify',
    // ...
  }
};
```

#### 2. **SubscriptionRenewalPopup.tsx** - Payment Processing
```typescript
// Changed from direct Lahza API call to backend proxy
const response = await axios.post(backendUrl, paymentData);

// Save payment state to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('subscription_payment_initiated', 'true');
localStorage.setItem('payment_reference', reference);
// ... other payment data
```

**UI Changes:**
- Close button (X) disabled during payment
- Cancel button disabled during payment
- "Processing payment..." message shown

#### 3. **usePaymentVerification.ts** - Verification Hook
```typescript
// Use backend endpoint instead of direct Lahza API
const backendUrl = `${PAYMENT_API_CONFIG.BACKEND_URL}${endpoint}`;

// Save verification results to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('subscription_payment_verified', 'true');
localStorage.setItem('subscription_payment_status', 'success');
```

## Webhook Setup Guide

### Step 1: Configure Webhook URL in Lahza Dashboard

1. Log in to your Lahza dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
3. Add webhook URL:
   ```
   https://bringusback.onrender.com/api/lahza-payment/{STORE_ID}/webhook
   ```
   Replace `{STORE_ID}` with your actual store MongoDB ID

4. Select events to listen for:
   - `charge.success` - Payment successful
   - `charge.failed` - Payment failed
   - `charge.pending` - Payment pending

### Step 2: Test Webhook

You can test the webhook manually using this curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://bringusback.onrender.com/api/lahza-payment/{STORE_ID}/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event": "charge.success",
    "data": {
      "reference": "ref_test123",
      "status": "success",
      "amount": "10000",
      "currency": "ILS",
      "metadata": {
        "storeId": "{STORE_ID}",
        "userId": "{USER_ID}",
        "planId": "{PLAN_ID}"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Step 3: Monitor Webhook Logs

Check backend logs for webhook events:
```
üì® Webhook received from Lahza
‚úÖ Payment successful, processing subscription activation
‚úÖ Subscription activated via webhook for store: {STORE_ID}
```

---

## Payment Flow (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: User Initiates Payment
```
User selects plan ‚Üí Fills form ‚Üí Clicks "Send Payment Request"
```

**Frontend:**
- Disables close button
- Saves payment data to localStorage
- Calls backend `/initialize` endpoint

**Backend:**
- Gets store's secret key from database
- Calls Lahza API to initialize payment
- Returns `authorization_url` to frontend

### Step 2: User Redirected to Payment Gateway
```
Frontend redirects user to Lahza payment page
```

**What happens:**
- User enters card details
- Lahza processes payment
- User may or may not return to your site

### Step 3: Webhook Processes Payment (Reliable!)
```
Lahza ‚Üí Backend Webhook (automatic)
```

**Backend webhook:**
1. Receives payment notification from Lahza
2. Verifies payment using reference
3. If successful, activates subscription:
   - Updates store subscription in database
   - Sets `status: 'active'`
   - Sets subscription end date
   - Logs subscription history

**This happens REGARDLESS of whether user returns to site!**

### Step 4: User Returns to Site (Optional)
```
User redirected back from payment gateway
```

**Frontend:**
- Checks URL for `?reference=xxx`
- Calls backend `/verify` endpoint
- Shows success/failure message
- Updates UI based on subscription status

---

## Handling the Three Bugs

### Bug 1: ‚úÖ Merchant Can Close Popup
**Solution:**
- Close button (X) hidden during payment processing
- Cancel button disabled during payment
- `paymentInProgress` state prevents closing

**Code:**
```tsx
{!paymentInProgress && (
  <button onClick={onClose}>X</button>
)}
{paymentInProgress && (
  <div>Processing payment...</div>
)}
```

### Bug 2: ‚úÖ Payment State Not Saved
**Solution:**
- All payment data saved to localStorage
- Verification saves success/failed status
- State persists across page reloads

**Saved Data:**
- `subscription_payment_initiated` - Payment started
- `payment_reference` - Transaction reference
- `subscription_payment_verified` - Verification complete
- `subscription_payment_status` - success/failed/pending
- `subscription_plan_id` - Selected plan
- All form data (email, name, amount, etc.)

### Bug 3: ‚úÖ Subscription Only Renewed on User Return
**Solution:**
- Webhook processes payment server-side
- Subscription activated automatically
- Works even if user never returns

**Webhook ensures:**
- Network failure ‚Üí Still activated
- Browser crash ‚Üí Still activated
- User closes tab ‚Üí Still activated
- Power outage ‚Üí Still activated

## Testing Checklist

### Test Case 1: Normal Payment Flow
1. ‚úÖ User selects plan and initiates payment
2. ‚úÖ Close button disappears during processing
3. ‚úÖ User redirected to Lahza
4. ‚úÖ User completes payment
5. ‚úÖ Webhook activates subscription
6. ‚úÖ User returns to site
7. ‚úÖ Frontend verifies and shows success
8. ‚úÖ Subscription active in database

### Test Case 2: User Doesn't Return
1. ‚úÖ User selects plan and initiates payment
2. ‚úÖ User redirected to Lahza
3. ‚úÖ User completes payment
4. ‚ùå User closes tab (doesn't return)
5. ‚úÖ Webhook still activates subscription
6. ‚úÖ Subscription active in database

### Test Case 3: Network Failure After Payment
1. ‚úÖ User completes payment at Lahza
2. ‚ùå Network disconnects
3. ‚úÖ Webhook activates subscription
4. ‚úÖ User can log out/log in to see active subscription

### Test Case 4: Payment Failure
1. ‚úÖ User initiates payment

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your backend `.env`:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Port
PORT=5001
```

**Note:** Lahza secret keys are stored per-store in MongoDB, not in .env

---

## Security Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ **Never expose secret keys in frontend**
   - All secret keys in backend database
   - Frontend never sees them

2. ‚úÖ **Validate webhook requests**
   - Backend verifies payment with Lahza
   - Don't trust webhook data blindly

3. ‚úÖ **Use HTTPS in production**
   - Webhook URL must be HTTPS
   - Protects data in transit

4. ‚úÖ **Log all payment events**
   - Backend logs all webhook events
   - Easy to debug and audit

5. ‚úÖ **Handle failures gracefully**
   - Show clear error messages
   - Save error state to localStorage
   - Allow user to retry

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Webhook not receiving events
**Solution:**
1. Check webhook URL in Lahza dashboard
2. Ensure URL is accessible (test with curl)
3. Check backend logs for incoming requests
4. Verify storeId in URL is correct

### Problem: Subscription not activating
**Solution:**
1. Check backend logs for webhook errors
2. Verify planId in metadata is valid
3. Check store's lahzaSecretKey is set
4. Verify subscription plan is active

### Problem: Frontend not updating after payment
**Solution:**
1. Check localStorage for payment state
2. Verify backend verification endpoint works
3. Check reference in URL after redirect
4. Look for errors in browser console

### Problem: Close button still visible during payment
**Solution:**
1. Check `paymentInProgress` state is set to `true`
2. Verify handleSubmit sets state before API call
3. Check React re-render is happening
